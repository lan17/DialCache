## Cache-path benchmark

From a repository checkout, install dependencies and run:

```bash
corepack pnpm benchmark:request-local
```

The command builds `dist` before reporting six scenarios:

- sequential request-local hits;
- sequential process-local hits;
- enabled bounded fallbacks;
- request-local coalescing fan-out;
- process coalescing fan-out; and
- Redis read-deadline coalescing.

The benchmark is a maintainer tool and is not included in the published
package. It asserts fallback counts, coalescing state, returned values, and one
semantic read and one cleaned-up deadline timer for the remote coalescing
scenario. It deliberately applies no timing threshold.

Override its work sizes with:

- `DIALCACHE_BENCH_ITERATIONS`; and
- `DIALCACHE_BENCH_FANOUT`.

## Releasing

Publishing starts by manually running the `Release` workflow from current
`main`.

After the package checks pass, Semantic Release selects the next version from
Conventional Commits since the highest stable `vX.Y.Z` tag:

- breaking changes bump major;
- `feat` bumps minor; and
- every other normal PR-title type bumps patch.

Patch types are `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`,
`chore`, `ci`, and `revert`. The highest required bump wins.

The workflow opens a `release: <version>` pull request whose only change is the
matching `package.json` version. `release` is a reserved Conventional Commit
type configured not to request another release, so the version-control commit
does not cause an extra bump.

GitHub marks workflow runs for a pull request opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` as
approval-required. Approve those runs, review the pull request, and squash-merge
it normally through the protected branch.

The merge triggers the publish job. Before any release side effect, it verifies:

- current `main`;
- the release commit subject;
- the one-file diff;
- the package version;
- the absent tag; and
- Semantic Release's independently calculated version and commit.

It then reruns the package checks and asks Semantic Release to:

1. create the matching Git tag;
2. publish the public npm package with provenance; and
3. publish the GitHub release.

The repository must enable **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
requests** under Actions workflow permissions.

The workflow uses that capability only to create the version pull request. It
never approves or merges one, and no ruleset bypass actor or persistent release
credential is required.
